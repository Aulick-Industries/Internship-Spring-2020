    "## Introduction to Software Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "![Requirements Engineering](https://miro.medium.com/max/2292/1*ApoaIZicyU0b7Jgg9MMJhw.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Software Engineering is much more involved than traditional Software Development, and relies heavily on having a defined process to complete the goals of a project. One of the very first parts of the Software Development process is finding and defining the requirements of a Software Project. The IEEE, or Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers is a welel-respected body within the field of Software Engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to IEEE standard 729, a requirement is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective\n",
    "* A condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification or other formally imposed documents\n",
    "* A documented representation of a condition or capability as in 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more basic terms, a Software Requirement is a feature or functionality of a system that must be included for a system to be complete. Every function that a Software System must be capable of must be documented as a Software Requirement. The process of defining these requirements is called Requirement Engineering. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Requirements engineering is a process of gathering and defining of what the services should be provided by the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Software Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "A software requirement can be of 3 types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Functional requirements\n",
    "2. Non-functional requirements\n",
    "3. Domain requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functional Requirements:** These are the requirements that the end user specifically demands as basic facilities that the system should offer. All these functionalities need to be necessarily incorporated into the system as a part of the contract. These are represented or stated in the form of input to be given to the system, the operation performed and the output expected. They are basically the requirements stated by the user which one can see directly in the final product, unlike the non-functional requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a hospital management system, a doctor should be able to retrieve the information of his patients. Each high-level functional requirement may involve several interactions or dialogues between the system and the outside world. In order to accurately describe the functional requirements, all scenarios must be enumerated.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways of expressing functional requirements e.g., natural language, a structured or formatted language with no rigorous syntax and formal specification language with proper syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-functional requirements:** These are basically the quality constraints that the system must satisfy according to the project contract. The priority or extent to which these factors are implemented varies from one project to other. They are also called non-behavioral requirements.\n",
    "They basically deal with issues like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Portability\n",
    "* Security\n",
    "* Maintainability\n",
    "* Reliability\n",
    "* Scalability\n",
    "* Performance\n",
    "* Reusability\n",
    "* Flexibility\n",
    "\n",
    "NFR’s are classified into following types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Interface constraints\n",
    "* Performance constraints: response time, security, storage space, etc.\n",
    "* Operating constraints\n",
    "* Life cycle constraints: mantainability, portability, etc.\n",
    "* Economic constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of specifying non-functional requirements requires the knowledge of the functionality of the system, as well as the knowledge of the context within which the system will operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Domain requirements:** Domain requirements are the requirements which are characteristic of a particular category or domain of projects. The basic functions that a system of a specific domain must necessarily exhibit come under this category. For instance, in an academic software that maintains records of a school or college, the functionality of being able to access the list of faculty and list of students of each grade is a domain requirement. These requirements are therefore identified from that domain model and are not user specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Functional Requirements\n",
    "* Users must be able to authenticate using a username and password\n",
    "* Once authenticated, users must be able to access account information and settings\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-functional Requirements\n",
    "* The system must be a web application in order to allow sign-ins from different types of devices\n",
    "* After providing a username and password, the user must either be authenticated or given an error message within 2 seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Domain Requirements\n",
    "* The system safety shall be assured according to standard IEC 60601-1:Medical Electrical Equipment – Part 1:General Requirements for Basic Safety and Essential Performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make sure you have a working understanding of the different types of Software Requirements, we'll try an example. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you're required to design an inventory management system for a client company. You are given the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A user must be able to register for an account using a new account code, username, and password\n",
    "2. A user must authenticate using a username and password\n",
    "3. There shall be two types of users, traditional users and administrators\n",
    "4. Administrators must be able to upgrade a users priviledges to administrator\n",
    "5. The system must be rendered as a web application\n",
    "6. Administrators shall be able to edit account information for users\n",
    "7. The system shall be usable on desktop devices and mobile devices\n",
    "8. Sign-ins must take no loner than 3 seconds after a user has provided a correct username and passwords\n",
    "9. Users must be able to view the assets checked out to them\n",
    "10. Users must be able to request certain assets.\n",
    "11. The system must be up 99% of the time.\n",
    "12. Administrators must be able to add new assets to the system.\n",
    "13. The system database must be secured using the standards for data security set forth by industry standards\n",
    "\n",
    "Classify these requirements into the three requirement types.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further your understanding, create probable requirements for an asset management system. Create 3 functional requirements, 3 non-functional requirements, and 1 domain requirement. Send all of your answers from this section to Jacob."
